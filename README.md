Hello. My name is ribbitpoison/venom the godfather. I have made this website in regards to my own research for the COD Modding Tools, such as Black Ops, World at War, and Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare.

Having learned from some of the best modders in the COD modding community since my early days, I became a full-fledged professional of the Black Ops Mod Tools. But there's still more I need to learn from.

From my research with the mod tools, I am more than welcome to share with everyone my discovery and my findings. Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/ribbitpoison/venommodding.github.io/wiki) so you can learn how to port assets properly, such as weapon ports, zombies, playermodels, and more!
